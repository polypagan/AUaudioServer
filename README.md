# AUaudioServer
Async UDP audio Server (send &amp; receive via multicast UDP using I2S)

After putting a lot of work into this, I've set it aside for a few months to work on other things.

Most of this kind of works. Sound quality is very poor and I'm not sure why.

I also discovered this puts a severe load on the WiFi network and may need a dedicated net to be useful.

Questions, suggestions, corrections, contributions, always welcome.
